# Python-Basic

A repository of some simple python scripts I have written.
---

grab_html.py -- A script that reads in an html filename, a start token and end token, and an output html filename.
The script will parse through the html file, find all instances that include the start and end token, and will output it to the specified html file location (and add html tags).  *Useful for pulling out li or href instances.
